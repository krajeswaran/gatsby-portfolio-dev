# Portfolio for developers

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d43853ed-10d4-4114-a64e-e4283d3677b2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/krajeswaran/deploys)

My portfolio site made with gatsby and react. Forked from [Smakosh's](https://github.com/smakosh/gatsby-portfolio-dev) project. Major differences are,

- Restructured and restyled for my portfolion needs: added summary description, added skills section, tweaked project settings
- Pulls github pinned repo's as a graphql source for gatsby(instead of repos by stars)
- Portfolio is entirely config-driven. Externalized theme colors, other parameters
- Cleaned up, deleted unused gatsby/react plugins
